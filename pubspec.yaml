# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/logo/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/flares/
    - assets/lotties/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  fonts:
    - family: product-sans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/product-sans/Product-Sans-Regular.ttf

    - family: source-sans-pro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/source-sans-pro/SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf

    - family: intro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/intro/Intro.otf

    - family: roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf

    - family: lato
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/lato/Lato-Regular.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
